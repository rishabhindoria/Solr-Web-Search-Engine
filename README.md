# Solr-Web-Search-Engine

• Created a web search engine using Solr.
•	Initialised a core on Solr and indexed all the required html pages on which user would submit queries. 
•	Used jQuery ajax request to send the query submitted by user to the Nodejs server.
•	Solr-node Nodejs library was then used to intiate a request to Solr server.
•	Results returned by the Solr server in the form of JSON were sent as a reponse by Nodejs server back to the jQuery ajax call which were then parsed and displayed on the front end of the web application.
